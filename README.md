# Module 3 Challenge - Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this moedule was to utilize python scripts is to parse more information from the document that we already have (election_results.csv). In this case, Seth and Tom wanted to also know the information for which county came with the highest turnout. This information could be used to gather where they should focus more of their effort in future elections such as where they could work on increasing voter turnout or to focus more of their effort in locations that already have high turnout so their work is more valuable. 


## Election Audit Results

#### County Results
 - The county with the highest turnout was Denver, with 82.8% of the total votes coming from that county.
   - This makes Denver by far the best place to focus future campaigns for similar elections. 


#### Candidate Results
 - The winning candidate of the election is Diana DeGette
 - Total of 272,892 votes
 - 73.8% of the votes


## Election Audit Summary

#### Utilization
As long as the voting results come in a similar format, this code can be lightly modified to work with any type of election or voting process to gather more data. Some of the modifications that would be made are the names of the categories that are being analyzed, as well as the column number for which the relevant data is located. 

#### Improvements
While it does not work with this CSV file as their is no more information to parse, more information can be parsed with more for loops, and for added efficiency when future-proofing the code, all the information can be parsed duringg a single for loop so that we do not have to go through the data multiple times.
